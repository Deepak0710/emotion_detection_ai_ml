Emotion Intelligence is a branch of A.I. that allows computers to understand human non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions.
Aim of this project is to classify peopleâ€™s emotions based on their facial images.
We are going to build, train and deploy to deep neural networks that automatically monitors people's emotions and expressions.
The original FER2013 dataset in Kaggle is available as a single csv file. I had converted into a dataset of images in the PNG format for training/testing.
